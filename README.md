<h1> Leprosy </h1>
<p> If there is someone hating you like "you are cheater" or something else and asking you to share your cheat you can teach this silly and annoying person. All you need is to share this two programs. First program is "installator". This part will shut down computer but before this it will remove some files that wictim will choose (such as folder with his counter-strike game). Also it will create task in register which will shut down the computer every time it will turn on. Task from register will run the second application which situated in "Uninstall" project. The login of this application is very easy: it runs command window and sends next command: "/c shutdown -s -f -t 00". </p>
